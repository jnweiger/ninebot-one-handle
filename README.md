Repairing a ninebot one handle giving more strength

The weakest part in a ninebot one handle is the hinge. The eye around the bolt is made from cast aluminum, just as the rest of the handle frame. 

To work with the handle frame, we completely remove the rubber coat. I did a long cut along the bottom and peeled the rubber away. The photos show the black rubber coat next the the light gray aluminum frame.

We completely remove the eye from the handle frame, leaving a flat wall, where we drill an 8mm hole. We replace the eye with a steel part that has a long pin with a threaded section, so that it 
can be screwed into the front wall of the cast aluminum part. The long pin is bent to follwo the curve of the frame. It is fixed in place with cast polyester. The screw does not need to be extra tight. The polyester connects the two parts.

Now, the mount of the handle is probably the next weakest part. It is also made from cast aluminium.
